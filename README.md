### The Problem
Working from home has been difficult, but important during the epidemic. I have been looking for Developer Advocate/Develepor Relations jobs during quarantine. This has meant that I have taken many high stakes video calls. I also have done some video recording and editing as conferences have moved online and are more likely than ever to request a pre-recorded talk.

My husband is working from home, and my retired mother lives with us. I have found that it is important to let people know when you are okay being interrupted and when an interruption is really costly. 

### My Solution

You can think of this project as a digital do not disturb sign on my office wall. I am utilizing LaunchDarkly feature flags to easily update my statuses. My family has the URL for my website, and can check to see what they can expect from my workday. I also threw in helpful info about our dog's status and a couple of things that are important to me from a more personal perspective. 

### Get your Own
You will need:
- A Microsoft Azure [account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
- Azure VS Code extension
- A LaunchDarkly account ([30-day](https://launchdarkly.com/start-trial/) trial available)

Optional:
- Install the [LaunchDarkly Slack App](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/integrations/slack) into a Slack community that you log into during your work day
